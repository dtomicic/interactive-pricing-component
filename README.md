## Project task
The task was to build a component where user can use the slider to set the amount of pageviews he wants and also he can select to be billed monthly or yearly (on yearly choice a 25% discount should be applied).

## Project overview
This project had me scared a bit at first because of the slider and the toggle button but I decided to give it a shot and was surprised how easily it all went in the end. Not without problems of course, I could say only two problems were slider and toggle button (I managed to find some nice solutions for them online) but I tried to make them like I need them and managed to do that pretty good only thing I didn't manage to do was for the slider to fill with color up to the circle and I've tried some solutions I've found online but didn't have any luck with any of them. With the toggle button I struggled a bit with positioning since I couldn't get it quite centered but managed to work my way around it.

Other than that had a bit of work in JavaScript with calculating the amount depending on the slider value and applying of the discount but I also managed to do that without any bigger problems.
